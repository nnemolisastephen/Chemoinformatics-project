## Src Tyrosine Phosphatase Protein (SHP2) Inhibitor Activity Predictor with Natural Language
<img align="center" src="images/shp2-visual.png" width="1000">
  
  SHP2 is a hot therapeutic target. SHP2 is a 68kDa protein with 593 amino acids that plays an important role in cell growth, 
  proliferation and differentiation, migration, and death. Its extensive role in RAS-MAPK and associated signaling pathways makes 
  SHP2 a critical target in the treatment of cancers associated with different RAS oncogenes. Finding high-efficacy inhibitors has been the goal of drug discovery.
  In this project, I leveraged machine learning and a large language model to develop an application that can predict the activity of a compound against 
  SHP2 while also explaining to the user whether the compound meets the Lipinski rule of five.

## üìå Features
**You must have your canonical smile for the application to make prediction.**
A canonical SMILES string is a unique, unambiguous representation of a chemical structure within the SMILES format. Example: CC1(CCN(CC1)C2=CN=C(C(=N2)N)C3=C(C(=CC=C3)Cl)Cl)N
One of the popular database to get a canonical smile for your compound is [www.pubchem.com](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
