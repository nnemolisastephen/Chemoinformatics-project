      <strong>SHP2 â€“ A Target of Interest</strong><br>
      SHP2 is a hot therapeutic target. SHP2 is a 68kDa protein with 593 amino acids that plays an important role in cell growth, 
      proliferation and differentiation, migration, and death. Its extensive role in RAS-MAPK and associated signaling pathways makes 
      SHP2 a critical target in the treatment of cancers associated with different RAS oncogenes. Finding high-efficacy inhibitors has been the goal of drug discovery.
      In this project, I leveraged machine learning and a large language model to develop an application that can predict the activity of a compound against 
      SHP2 while also explaining to the user whether the compound meets the Lipinski rule of five.
